# snake-ii-remake
this game is a sketchy remake of the Snake II game, originally made for nokia phones in the 2000's. i wrote the game in c++ and c, and I created this game in my spare time, I have no other intention besides entertaining people. and remember that the game is in Brazilian Portuguese. 

snakeii is the 64-bit version of the game, while snakeii32 is the 32-bit version of the game.

you can create your own version of the game, but don't forget to give credit to me and Rodrigo Schio, he helped me to create and publish the game on his old website, that unfortunately doesn't exists anymore (https://rodrigoschio.appspot.com).
