# snake-ii-remake
this game is a remake of the Snake II game, originally made for nokia phones in the 2000's. i wrote the game in c++ and c, and I created this game in my spare time, I have no other intention besides entertaining people. and remember that the game is in Brazilian Portuguese. you can create your own version of the game, but don't forget to give credit to me and Rodrigo Schio, he helped me to create and publish the game on his website.
(his website is in brazilian portuguese):
